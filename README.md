# K-Means-Digit-Recognition-Analysis

Implemented an advanced K-means clustering algorithm that successfully clustered handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. The algorithm was analyzed for accuracy in assigning digits to clusters, revealing insights into the distinguishability of various digits by the algorithm. The results indicated that some digits were more easily distinguished than others, providing valuable information for future improvements in digit recognition systems.
